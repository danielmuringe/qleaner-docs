# Use Cases

## CI/CD Pipeline
Run Qleaner in dry-run mode during builds to fail if unused files are detected (ensuring a clean main branch).

## Legacy Refactoring
Heavily useful when migrating large legacy codebases to new frameworks, identifying dead routes and components.

## Bundle Optimization
Use `qleaner summary --largest-files` to find the biggest contributors to your bundle size.
